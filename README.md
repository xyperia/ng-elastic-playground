# Angular Chat-Like App

This is an Angular frontend application designed to simulate a real-time chat interface. It communicates with a backend API that provides token-by-token responses, making it feel like a conversational flow, similar to apps like Telegram.

## Features
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: User's messages appear on the right, and responses from the backend API appear on the left.
- **Token-by-Token Streaming**: The response from the backend is updated in real-time, simulating the process of typing and responding.
- **Telegram-like UI/UX**: The interface is styled to resemble Telegram's chat application for a familiar user experience.
